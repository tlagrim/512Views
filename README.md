512 Views is an online newspaper that originated from the St. Edward's University 
newspaper, Hilltop Views. The motive behind 512 Views is to redirect emphasis 
away from the University news, and expand coverage to the local Austin area, 
creating new, external grounds for news and media. Currently, the website will 
debut this coming Spring 2016 in timely fashion for the South by Southwest Music, 
Film, and Interactive Festival.
